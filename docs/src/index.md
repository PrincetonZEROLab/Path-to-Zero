# Path To Zero

Welcome to the [Path To Zero](https://github.com/PrincetonZEROLab/Path-to-Zero) documentation!

## What is Path To Zero?
Path To Zero is a **multi-stage planning under deep uncertainy strategy game** designed to help players understand the challenges of decarbonizing the electricity sector. The objective of the game is to develop a **portfolio of resources** that can meet the demand at the lowest cost while also achieving **stringent environmental goals**. 

The game **simulates** electricity system operations, allowing players to test out their **strategies**, build intuition about how power systems operate, and develop a plan to create a portfolio of resources that meets both their **reliability and clean energy goals**, which are two of the three objectives for which they are scored in the game.

!!! tip "Credits"
    The game was created and designed by [Jesse D. Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) and developed by the [Princeton ZERO Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/) and the [Princeton RSE Group](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/services/research-software-engineering) at Princeton University.

!!! note "Design"
    The backend is developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and [JuMP](http://jump.dev/), while the frontend is built using the [GenieFramework](https://genieframework.com/).
