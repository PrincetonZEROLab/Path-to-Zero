# Path To Zero

Welcome to the [Path To Zero](https://github.com/PrincetonZEROLab/Path-to-Zero) documentation!

## What is Path To Zero?
Path To Zero is a multi-stage planning under deep uncertainy strategy game designed to help players understand the challenges of decarbonizing the electricity sector. The purpose of the game is to develop a portfolio of resources that will meet the demand at the lowest cost while also achieving stringent environmental goals. 

The game involves a simulation of electricity system operations (developed in Julia and JuM), which helps players test out their strategies, build intuition about how power systems operation, and develop a plan to build a portfolio of resources that meets their reliability and clean energy goals, which are two of the three objectives for which they are scored in the game.
